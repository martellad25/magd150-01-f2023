>The following is a list of assignments from a UW-W MAGD class. Programs were created using [this](www.p5js.org) website. 

##Assignment Five 

**Goal:** Create an image that includes interactivity through buttons and mouse pressing.

The piece includes an image of a laptop. It includes the following buttons:

* A light grey button on the upper left corner of the "screen" turns yellow when the mouse is pressed within the bounds of the circle.  
* A "power" button on the top left of the "keyboard". When the mouse is within the bounds of the rectangle, _and_ "p" is pressed, the "screen" turns dark blue and the code does not loop.


##Assignment 7

**Goal:** Create an image using custom functions embedded in the draw() function.

This piece includes the spray of a sprinkler that varies in water color while a sun with sunglasses orbits behind. Special features include:

* The sun rotates slowly around a translated point. It includes a main circle, a translucent circle as an aura, a smile curve, sunglasses, and two reflective lines on each lens.  
* The spray of water follows an arc. The particles are circles that are randomised in this form. The color is chosen at random from an array stated beforehand.
 * I had originally intended to make a rainbow that fluctuated between a few preset tones of each color. However, I struggled to get that to work without affecting the color of the other stripes.


##Assignment 10

**Goal:** Create an image using an external library accessible from the P5JS.org libraries.

This piece uses a [scribble library](https://github.com/generative-light/p5.scribble.js) created by _jawu_ and _ognjenvucko_. I went for a pastel, girly look with this piece:

* A star with a blue stroke and a yellow hachure that wiggles at a slow speed
* the name of the library (scribble) in its own style in a darker pink.
 * Despite being more simple, I really enjoy the scribbly, doodly style this library creates. I think it is adorable and I would love to do more with it. 
 * My largest critique is that the order of points and control points for curves differs from default p5js functions. It made the creation more difficult, but I figured it out eventually.
